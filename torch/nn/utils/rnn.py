class PackedSequence(PackedSequence_):
    r"""Holds the data and list of batch_sizes of a packed sequence.

    All RNN modules accept packed sequences as inputs.

    Note:
        Instances of this class should never be created manually. They are meant
        to be instantiated by functions like :func:`pack_padded_sequence`.

        Batch sizes represent the number elements at each sequence step in
        the batch, not the varying sequence lengths passed to
        :func:`pack_padded_sequence`.  For instance, given data  ``abc`` and `d`
        the ``PackedSequence`` would be ``adbc`` with ``batch_sizes=[2,1,1]``.

        data (Variable): Variable containing packed sequence
        batch_sizes (list[int]): list of integers holding information about
            the batch size at each sequence step

    B is batch size. It's equal to the number of elements in ``sequences``.
    T is length longest sequence.
    L is length of the sequence.
    * is any number of trailing dimensions, including none.

    Example:
